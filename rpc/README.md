# Package RPC

The rpc package contains the API handling routes that are served when the openx platform is run. It should ideally be run on the platform side (the website hosting the frontend) so that the frontend can make easy calls to localhost with minimal latency. It can also be run as a standalone repo with the risk of the platform's API being exposed to the wild and is not ideal to run a platform system.
