# User stories

Broadly, there are three kinds of stories that we can show with the help of the projects we have:

1. The investment story (4, 2, 1)
2. The pre-investment story (2, 1)
3. The post-investment story (7,8)

To split the projects in a unique way and to cover all of them, we can have

1. The investment story represented by 4 and the seed investment story represented by 2
2. The pre investment story represented by 1
3. Pre-ownership flip story of 7 and post ownership flip story of 8

This gives us five different situations which we c an model and explain on, which was the original idea behinf having 5 projects to display:

## The investment story

- From the perspective of a person who's new to the platform - cover signup, login and then the explore page. Explain that each user who signs up  automatically receives a given amount of XLM and stablecoin so that investment is easier. Click on project 4 (lancaster), walk them through details, payback intervals and stuff and invest $1000 in the project. Click on the "Main Wallet" in the investor dashboard to take them to the stellar explorer. Explain OpenX assets and what they denote.

- As the same  user, try investing in project 2 (seed investment in PR Schools Bond 1) and explain to them why we cap seed investment, risks associated with it and the increased returns ratio that it provides. Assets are the same, so it shouldn't be necessary to cover this part again.

## The pre investment story

The pre investment stage specifics and the stage transition rules can be covered by displaying project 1 (the Rwanda project). We can walk people through what the different stages are, the role played by originators and how stage transition works. There isn't much to show on the frontend on this because we haven't covered stage transitions but I guess that's part of the originator engine which is slated for phase 2.

## Pre Ownership flip story

Pre Ownership can be showcased in a nice way by displaying the Puerto Rico project that we have right now. The idea is to cover automatic payments, the percentage shift that occurs each time a user pays back towards the system and the various breach scenarios involved, making this story one of the longest and most important one amongst the 5 that we have. We should also login as the recipient (`SUpasto@test.com:password`) and show the blockchain history from the recipient dashboard in order to get an idea of what assets the recipient gets after investment and how payback works in such a scheme. This would also contain a tiny example of the waterfall scheme of payouts, so we can cover that as well

## Post Ownership flip story

Post Ownership flip can be showcased by showing the stage 8 project (New Haven Shelter Solar). By showcasing this project, we can aim to explain the ownership flip mechanism, what happens after the ownership flip and the processes associated with that. I think this would contain the smallest number of things to explain among the five projects we have, so maybe we can borrow stuff from the pre-ownership flip story and explain that here, reducing the load on that.
