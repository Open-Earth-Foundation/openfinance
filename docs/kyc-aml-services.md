# KYC Services

This doc aims to have a list of potential KYC/AML services that we could use in order to issue stablecoin and onboard users for the platform. There are broadly two classes of services which do KYC/AML - Traditional services focused on the finance industry and newer cryptocurrency focused AML compliance services. We will be focused on the cryptocurrency based service providers for the rest of this document.

1. Mimiro (ComplyAdvantage)

[Mimiro](https://mimiro.com) is a company that does AML with the help of AI and technology. Looks to be a fairly nice platform with in depth explanation of what services they offer and statistics on past performance

2. iCOMPLYICO

[iCOMPLYICO](https://icomplyico.com) is a company that does both ICO review services and KYC. Claim to have a list of tools that c ould be useful for law enforcement and compliance, but there seems to be no list of partners mentioned explicitly on the website.

## Jumio

[Jumio](https://www.jumio.com/ico-aml-kyc-compliance/) seems to have a relatively moderate website describing what it does but doesn't go in detail regarding what methods they use. It also does not have a list of partners like Mimiro

## IBC Group

[IBC Group](https://ibcgroup.io/equity-crowdfunding/) claims to do KYC/AML compliance and have a nice website explaining their services and the interesting part is they claim to be interested in helping organisations do equity crowdfunding, which is of special interest to us.

## Ambisafe

[Ambisafe]https://ambisafe.com) is a company that is pretty famous due to them being involved in the Parity hack. A description on their website states "accredited investors, KYC, AML, and purchases in BTC, ETH and USD wire transfer." meaning they could maybe offer a fiat off and on ramp as well

## Stronghold

Stronghold, the stablecoin provider on stellar can also act as a KYC provider before issuing stablecoin solving a whole lot of issues for us.

## Centre

Centre offers KYC/AML to exchanges and could potentially help us on the front since Coinbase and Circle both have excellent KYC services

## Civic

[Civic](https://www.civic.com) is a blockchain project which aims to implement some sort of decentralised ID verification.

## Coinlist

[CoinList](https://coinlist.co/help/what-is-complyapi) is a popular API service used by ICOs for KYC/AML compliance.


## Other Services

These are services that claim to offer only kyc as a service (apart from other things). Most companies in the space are offering ICOs as a service and KYC/AML is bundled into that package. An example of that is ICOBox, which charges 40btc + 3% of the token sale amount for its services. Another category is traditional banking partners such as Deloitte, who offer consulting services for ICOs and companies.
