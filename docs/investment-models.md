# Investment Models

There are multiple investment models and it might be quite daunting to see at first glance. But rest assured, you can get up to speed on all this by following this guide to understanding the various models that are relevant to the openx platform. This doc would mostly contain links out to other good writeups since they do the explaining better than we can:

## Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is a broad category and has multiple instruments within it. A beginner's guide to crowdfunding can be found at

2. http://www.krowdmentor.com/crowdfunding-guide/

Broadly there are four types of crowdfunding - equity crowdfunding, debt crowdfunding, donation crowdfunding and rewards crowdfunding

## Donation Crowdfunding

An example of this type of fundraising model would be a site like GoFundMe / Patreon which encourages people to ask for help and there is no interest associated with the amount loaned to individual investors

## Rewards Crowdfunding

An example of a rewards based crowdfunding model is where the investor gets something other than capital / a good in return for his investment. Taking the example of a game, a designer may allow investors belonging to a certain category to design a custom boss or design special levels which only the investors can play.

### Equity Crowdfunding

Equity crowdfunding is when a person who wants to raise funds offers a percentage of the company's future shares in exchange for capital today

## Debt Crowdfunding

As the name may suggest, a debt crowdfunding model is when an investor gives a specific amount of capital for a fixed period in exchange for fixed interest over a number of years.

## Regulation

While introducing the above tools for raising funds, it is also good to know the regulations pertaining to the various models and that can be found over at the SEC's website

# Energy Specific
## Tax Partnership Flips
Partnership flips are used to raise tax equity in the US renewable energy market. They are not the only structure for doing so, but they are the most common, and they are the only way to raise tax equity for wind farms and other projects on which production tax credits will be claimed.
